   	  <h2>Seriously, though.</h2>
   	  <p>What am I supposed to be writing here? Stuff about me? Uh...ok:</p>
   	  <ul>
   	  	<li>Name: Ari Ross</li>
   	  	<li>Major: Graphic Design &amp; Interactive Media</li>
   	  	<li>Year: Senior (5th year)</li>
   	  </ul>

   		<h2>Am I Supposed to Write More?</h2>
   		<p>...but, like...no. Cause why would I want stuff about me on the Internet?</p>

   		<h2>Interactive Websites</h2>
   		<p>Here's some cool things:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li><a href="http://journey.lifeofpimovie.com/" target="_blank">Journey of the <em>Life of Pi</em> movie</a>
   			  <ul>
   			  	<li>Ugh. Parallax.  Like THAT hasn't been done before. But this site uses it in a way that effectively details the making of the movie.  So it's cool.</li>
   			  </ul>
   			</li>
   			<li><a href="http://winkttd.es/#/home" target="_blank">Wink</a>
   			  <ul>
   			  	<li>I don't know what this site is, but I think the set up is kinda fun (feels a bit chaotic, and not in a good way...but the idea of it is cool).</li>
   			  </ul>
   			</li>
   		</ul>
