  <h1>Global Attitudes &amp; Trends</h1>

  <p><strong>Spring 2014 Survey Data</strong> found
    <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/category/datasets/" target="_blank">here</a>.
     A survey conducted on 44 nations asked about how citizens felt about their
     day was going, how they would rate their life, how they would rate certain
     aspects of their life, and a bunch of other questions.
     <br />
     <br />
     Sample Questions:
     <ul>
       <li>Q1. To begin, how would you describe your day today—has it been a
         typical day, a particularly good day, or a particularly bad day?</li>
      <br />
      <li>Q2B. Imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10
        at the top.  The top represents the best possible life for you; the
        bottom, the worst possible life.  On which step do you feel you
        personally stand at present time?</li>
     <br />
      <li>Q24. Which one of these issues is the most important for the
        government to address first – rising prices, a lack of employment
        opportunities, the gap between the rich and the poor or public debt?</li>
     <br />
       <li>Q134. Do you have friends or relatives who live in another country
         that you write to, telephone or visit regularly?</li>
      <br />
      <li>Q148E. And in your household, do you have any of the following? Count
        only those that are in working order. -- computer</li>
     </ul>
   </p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Questions asked</li>
  <li>Country</li>
  <li>Attitudes/Answers per person</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visualization ideas:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Map of world, each country color coded by average happiness rating.  Click
  on country to see breakdown of people's answers, and show answers to questions
  that might affect happiness (e.g. "How much of an optimist do you consider yourself?").</li>
  <br />
  <li>Consider asking user to input their response to questions, and be able
  to compare their happiness to average of certain countries</li>
  <br />
  <li><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371" target="_blank">This</a> looks
    pretty cool...<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock" target="_blank">bl.ocks.org
    </a></li>
  <br />
  <li>A lot of different questions (e.g. "Of these possibilities, which do you
    consider to be the biggest threat to the world?", or "How much of an optimist
    do you consider yourself?") - use different visualizations for each question</li>
  <br />
  <li>For each country, split into sections based on questions?</li>
  <br />
  <li>Compare people's answers to questions based on how they answered other
    questions?</li>
</ul>
